      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;If someone loves a flower, of which just one single blossom grows in all the millions and millions of stars, it is enough to make him happy just to look at the stars. He can say to himself, "Somewhere, my flower is there…" But if the sheep eats the flower, in one moment all his stars will be darkened… And you think that is not important! </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Flowers are so inconsistent! But I was too young to know how to love her… </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;My flower is ephemeral, and she has only four thorns to defend herself against the world. And I have left on my planet, all alone! </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Seen from a slight distance, that would make a splendid spectacle. The movements of this army would be regulated like those of the ballet in the opera. First would come the turn of the lamplighters of New Zealand and Australia. Having set their lamps alight, these would go off to sleep. Next, the lamplighters of China and Siberia would enter for their steps in the dance, and then they too would be waved back into the wings. After that would come the turn of the lamplighters of Russia and the Indies; then those of Africa and Europe, then those of South America; then those of South America; then those of North America. And never would they make a mistake in the order of their entry upon the stage. It would be magnificent. </p>
